    "\n",
    "This branch of the Quotation Tool contains an experimental coreference feature. This feature provides the proper name of the speaker when only a pronoun is provided. Considering the following text as an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "The Prime Minister said \"Inflation is the primary concern of this government.\" He continued, \"It is a pressing issue for every Australian.\"\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature is experimental and has not been merged into the main Quotation Tool because of a memory leak issue. A relatively small corpus will cause a relatively large amount of memory to be consumed. The Binder instances used to ensure the portability of the application have limited memory and this issue has caused the Quotation Tool to unexpectedly stop working. If coreference is not a key requirement in your analysis, it is advised to switch to the main Quotation Tool (found on the main branch).\n",
    "\n",
    "_Recommended solutions_\n",
    "\n",
    "If the corpus you are attempting to analyse is unable to be processed by the Quotation Tool, try one of the following potential solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Divide the corpus into smaller chunks and process each one individually\n",
    "- Run the Quotation Tool on your own machine by downloading and running the code in the repository\n",
    "- Reduce the size of individual documents by extracting the relevant context. This can be done with the [ATAP Context Extractor](https://github.com/Australian-Text-Analytics-Platform/atap-context-extractor)"
