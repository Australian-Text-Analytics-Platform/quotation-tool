The White House did not immediately offer a response to the actions. \\n\\nWhile some cheered the platforms\\' response, experts noted that these actions follow years of hemming and hawing regarding Trump and his supporters spreading dangerous misinformation and encouraging violence that contributed to Wednesday\\'s events.\\n\\nJennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University communications professor and an expert on social media, said what happened in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday is a direct result of Trump\\'s use of social media to spread propaganda and disinformation, and that the platforms should bear some responsibility for their previous inaction.\\n\\nPolice secure U.S. Capitol after pro-Trump rioters cause bedlam at heart of U.S. government\\nSenate, House resoundingly reject 1st challenge to Biden win hours after angry mob storms U.S. Capitol\\n\"This is what happens,\" Grygiel said. \"We didn\\'t just see a breach at the Capitol. Social media platforms have been breached by the president repeatedly. This is disinformation. This was a coup attempt in the United States.\"\\n\\nGrygiel said the platform\\'s decision to remove the video — and Twitter\\'s suspension — are too little, too late.\\n\\n\"They\\'re creeping along towards firmer action,\" Grygiel said, calling Trump \"Exhibit A\" for the need for greater regulation of social media. \"Social media is complicit in this because he has repeatedly used social media to incite violence. It\\'s a culmination of years of propaganda and abuse of media by the president of the United States.\"\\n\\n\\nAn explosion caused by a police munition is seen while supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump gather in front of the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Jan. 6.
