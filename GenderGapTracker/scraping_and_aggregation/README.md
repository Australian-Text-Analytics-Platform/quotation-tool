# Scraping and aggregation
This section contains the code we used for scraping news article content from various Canadian outlets, as well as the code we use to extract aggregate statistics from the database. The news data processed in our NLP pipeline was downloaded from public and subscription websites of newspapers, under the ‘fair dealing’ provision in Canada’s Copyright Act. This means that the data can be made available (upon signing a license agreement) *only* for private study and/or research purposes, and **not** for commercial purposes.

## 1. Scrapers

### Installation
We use the following tools for data scraping and storage.

 * MongoDB: Installation instructions [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/).
 * Install Python 3.6+ and follow the below instructions to prepare the Python environment. Make sure that `gcc`, `build-essential` and `python3-devel` (on Red Hat/CentOS), or `python3-dev` (on ubuntu) are installed on the system. Also, install `python3-venv` for managing virtual environments.
 * Newspaper3k: We use the [newspaper library](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper) to help in the process of collecting data. However, we customized this library for our own purposes, hosted at: https://github.com/aleaugustoplus/newspaper
     * Install the customized newspaper library using the `requirements.txt` file in [this location](https://github.com/aleaugustoplus/newspaper/blob/master/requirements.txt).
     * `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## News Sources
We scrape news articles from the following Canadian news organizations' websites. The articles in our database date back to October 2018.

#### English
1. CBC News
2. CTV News
3. Global News
4. HuffPost Canada<sup>*</sup>
5. National Post
6. The Globe And Mail
7. The Star

> <sup>*</sup> HuffPost Canada stopped publishing articles in March 2021. As a result, our database only contains articles from this outlet until February 2021.

#### French
1. Journal De Montreal
2. La Presse
3. Le Devoir
4. Le Droit
5. Radio Canada
6. TVA News

Each outlet's news content is retrieved from their RSS feeds by running the required media collectors. Some examples of usage are shown below.

### Example of usage for individual scrapers

```sh
python3.6 WomenInMedia/scraper/mediaCollectors.py "Huffington Post"
python3.6 WomenInMedia/scraper/mediaCollectors.py "Journal De Montreal"
```

See the full list of valid (case-sensitive) outlet names in the file `mediaCollectors.py`.


### `config.py` parameters
We use a `config.py` file to specify our MongoDB connections settings, to write the newly scraped data. Note that we specify the `readPreference` argument as `primary` here to ensure that we first read the most up-to-date items from our 3-set replica database, check for existing items with an identical URL, and only then perform the write operation (this helps avoid duplicates).

```python
# Production config
MONGODB_HOST = ["mongo0", "mongo1", "mongo2"]
MONGODB_PORT = 27017
MONGO_ARGS = {
    "readPreference": "primary",
    "username": USERNAME,
    "password": PASSWORD,
}
DBS_NAME = 'mediaTracker'
COLLECTION_NAME = 'media'
```

## 2. Aggregate statistics
We also provide code showing how we calculate aggregate statistics for the results shown in the paper, as well as for the numbers shown on our dashboards. These statistics are calculated on a daily or monthly basis, depending on the situation.

### Daily aggregate statistics
We pre-compute daily aggregated statistics for the total number of male, female and unknown gender sources and people mentioned, from each outlet. These are written to a separate collection with the appropriate indexes, so that they can be efficiently retrieved for display on [our live dashboard](https://gendergaptracker.informedopinions.org/).

To generate daily statistics on the most recently processed data, run the command below:

```sh
python3 WomenInMedia/scraper/tools.py "generate_daily_collection"
```

### Monthly aggregate statistics
For [our research dashboard](https://gendergaptracker.research.sfu.ca/), we aggregate our results on a monthly basis. This is primarily for us to study trends in our topic models each month, as well as to analyze the top quoted men and women over time.

Calculate the top 50 quoted men and women for a particular month by specifying the month and year as follows:

```sh
cd monthly_aggregate
# Calculate top 50 male & female sources for all outlets for December 2020
python3 monthly_top_sources.py --year 2020 --month 12
```

Similarly, we can calculate the top 50 quoted men and women each month to study the top quoted people's quote counts as a time series. We limit the calculation to just the top 50 for querying-efficiency reasons (otherwise the time series lookup can become inefficient). Each month's calculation is run one at a time, sequentially, as follows.

```sh
cd monthly_aggregate
# Calculate the quote counts for each of the top 50 male & female sources for all outlets for April, May and June 2020
python3 monthly_top_sources_timeseries.py --year 2020 --month 4
python3 monthly_top_sources_timeseries.py --year 2020 --month 5
python3 monthly_top_sources_timeseries.py --year 2020 --month 6
```

### Custom aggregate statistics
To calculate the numbers reported in our research paper, we write custom queries submitted via `pymongo`, as shown in the `custom_aggregate` directory. Any combination of the queries, as defined in `queries.py`, can be run for a custom date range and for specific outlets as shown below.

```sh
cd custom_aggregate

# Calculate top 100 male & female sources for all outlets (default) for October 2018
python3 run.py --begin_date 2018-10-01 --end_date 2018-10-31 --top_sources_female --top_sources_male --limit 100 --sort desc

# Calculate the per-outlet source count stats for CBC News and Huffington Post, for December 2020
python3 run.py --begin_date 2020-12-01 --end_date 2020-12-31 --outlet_stats --outlets "CBC News,Huffington Post"

# Calculate overall stats (no. of sources, people and authors per gender) for CTV News between April-November 2020
python3 run.py --begin_date 2020-04-01 --end_date 2020-11-30 --db_stats --outlets "CTV News"
```
