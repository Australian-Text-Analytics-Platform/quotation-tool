## requirements.txt intentionally minimal for Binder.
## All core packages are specified in environment.yml to avoid duplicate binary installs.
## Leave this file present (empty of heavy deps) so repo2docker skips large pip reinstall phase.
## If adding truly pip-only packages not already in environment.yml's pip section, list them here.
